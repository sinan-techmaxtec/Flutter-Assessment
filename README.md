## Task Overview

Your goal is to build a **Flutter application** that includes the following features:

### Vehicle Management (CRUD)

- Implement **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** functionality for vehicles.  
- Display the list of vehicles with their basic details using **tiles or cards**.

### Media Capture

- Enable users to **capture photos and videos** for each vehicle using the device's camera.

### Camera Overlay

- Provide **image guide overlays** during photo capture to help users take well-aligned images.

### Media Preview

- Display all captured media (images and videos) for each vehicle in a **preview section**, organized for easy access and review.

### (Optional) Object Detection

- Optionally, integrate an **object detection API** (e.g., Google Cloud Vision) to identify and annotate objects within the captured images.

## Tech Requirements

- The solution should be built using **Flutter only** â€“ **no backend** implementation is required.  
- Use Flutter state management of your choice.
